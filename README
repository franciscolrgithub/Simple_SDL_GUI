Welcome, this is SSG (not the gun) which stands for Simple SDL GUI.

If you want to compile this code you'll need SDL2 and SDL2_image.

To compile it you have to execute `make` and then `./main` in the shell
while in the "Simple_SDL_GUI" folder

What is coded to date?

------------SSG_BUTTONS------------
Buttons have an effect when being pressed for feedback purposes
They include a SSG_TEXT box which is kind of a tag

------------SSG_TEXT------------
Texts only have one font and one possible size for the moment
